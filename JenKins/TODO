Exercise 2: The "Multi-Tasker" (Parallel Stages)

Goal: Speed up your pipeline by running tasks at the same time.

Task: Create a pipeline with a stage called "Parallel Checks".
Inside this stage, use the parallel block to run two separate
stages simultaneously:

    Static Analysis: Use echo 'Running linter...'.

    Security Scan: Use echo 'Checking for vulnerabilities...'.

    Observation: After running this, look at the Stage View in
    Jenkins; you should see these two tasks stacked vertically,
    finishing at the same time.
